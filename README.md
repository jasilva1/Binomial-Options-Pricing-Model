# Binomial-Options-Pricing-Model

I've uploaded code for both the one-step core model I created, this was simply a starting point and helped me understand exactly what was going on within the model.
I've also uploaded the code for the multi-step model. When run this allows you to enter a stock ticker symbol, an expiration time frame, number of steps, and strike price. 
This model uses:
- numpy
- yfinance
- math
- streamlit

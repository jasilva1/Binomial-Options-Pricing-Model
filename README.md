# Binomial-Options-Pricing-Model


This model uses:
- numpy
- yfinance
- math
- streamlit

This model is currently only for a one-step model, this is only a starting point that does the model calculations. It doesn't currently output or display anything. Print statements can be added to the code to check the calculations.

I'm in the process of making it allow for multiple steps, more user friendly, and data visualization.
